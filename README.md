# Projects
Various projects from classes during college:

All files labeled "hmwrkX", "homework6_actually" and the "MushroomFINAL" are based on my statistical learning class, based on the ISLR 
book which can be found here: http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/

All files labeled "Anthony-Anderson-HWX", "AnthonyAnderson_3675_report", "Assignment4" are based on my statistical computing class, 
essentially a introduction to R coding, and applications for statistical analysis or visualization. 

File "AnthonyAnderson_3515_proj" is from my Design of Experiments class, which is about how to design experiments ahead of time to answer
the right questions in the most efficient effective way, including when things like time and budget are a concern.
